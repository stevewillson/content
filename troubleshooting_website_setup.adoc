= Troubleshooting when Creating a Website

This is meant to list common issues to check when creating a website, not an all inclusive list but will solve many problems

== DNS

DNS - ensure that your hostname resolves to your expected IP address

If trying to direct to your home IP, use `ipchicken.com` or do a search for `what is my IP address`

Verify your nameservers are what you expect them to be: `nslookup <HOSTNAME>`

See what your hostname resolves to: `dig <HOSTNAME>`

On linux install the `dnsutils` package

== Firewall

Verify that your firewall is configured to allow connections to the port you're trying to connect to

80 or 443 or whatever port you host your website/service

TIP: You can use ssh port forwarding to set up a tunnel from a trusted host to sidestep this issue

Set up an SSH server on a computer

On the host that the website is hosted enter:

`ssh <USER>@<HOSTNAME> -D <SOCKS_PORT>`

This creates a tunnel from the computer with the ssh server to the computer hosting the website

Configure your browser on the ssh server computer to use a `SOCKS5 Proxy` and do not exempt localhost from the proxied addresses. Then attempt to connect to your host using the browser.

In the browser `localhost:<PORT IP IS LISTENING ON>` you can verify that your website is working through the tunnel

== Service is listening on host

Verify that there is a service and it is listening

`ss -anotp` Look for the expected port

== Webserver is configured properly

Verify website is set up 

=== nginx

File locations

`/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default`

`/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`

Can test the config file using `nginx -t`

Review logs

`/var/log/nginx/access.log`

Use `tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log` in a terminal to watch live as the access.log file is updated

Also view `/var/log/nginx/error.log`

== Encryption

SSL - use letsencrypt.com to set up encryption
