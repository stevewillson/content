= Guac Server Setup
Steve Willson 
1/25/18

Goal: Use guacamole to get a terminal through HTML5

Chase Wright's docker setup script will attempt to install docker-ce, use the digital ocean website below to install docker-ce from the docker repository.

== Install docker

Follow instructions at the docker website

https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-16-04

== Use Chase Wright's docker script to install guacamole

https://www.chasewright.com/guacamole-mysql-docker/

 $ sudo ./docker-install.sh -m MYSQL_PASSWORD -g GUAC_DB_PASSWORD

== Testing locally

Test that the docker containers are set up properly, do a SSH SOCKSv5 proxy and request the guacamole page

From a local computer

 $ ssh USER@SERVER_W_GUAC -D SOCKS_PORT

Go to web browser and set the proxy connection to SOCKSv5 and remove localhost from the 'Do not use proxy for these addresses' field.

Browse to the website `http://localhost:8080/guacamole` and login with `guacadmin` / `guacadmin` credentials.

Create a new user and attempt to create a connection. Make sure you change the dropdown to `SSH`.

== Configuration to proxy through nginx

This configuration will allow you to host guacamole on a server and use a reverse proxy to connect to the server.

Edit the `/etc/nginx/sites-available/willson.tk` file
