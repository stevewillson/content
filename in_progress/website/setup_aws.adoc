= Setting up a Web Server on AWS
Steve Willson

.Steps
* Set up a new instance
* Set up DNS to point to the new server
* Login to the new instance and configure services
* Allow desired ports through the Amazon firewall (I use ports 80, 443, and 6789(SSH))

== Setup the server with Amazon Web Services

Go to https://aws.amazon.com, register for a free account.

Launch an Ubuntu 16.04 instance, create a new key file to connect to the instance using SSH using key authentication.

 $ ssh -i "ubuntu_key_1.pem" ubuntu@ec2-18-219-249-95.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com

Add the ports that you would like allowed in the 'Network & Security' area of AWS 

== Register a domain name

Go to freenom.com or another registrar to sign up for a domain name. Set the DNS name servers to be those at cloudflare (provided when you register for an account)

== Set up the domain name servers

Use cloudflare, change the DNS records to point to the new server's IP address

Verify that your DNS records point to the right IP address

 $ sudo apt-get install dnsutils
  
 $ dig YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME

You should see a response with an 'A' record that points to the IP address specified

== Edit SSH Server Config File

Edit file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`

Change line `Port XXXX` to your high port. (Ex `Port 5678`)

Allow password login

Restart the SSH service

 $ sudo service ssh restart

== Add a new user

Add the new user, add to the `sudo` group

 $ useradd user

Edit the `/etc/group` file to include the user in the sudo group

Remove the `/home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys` file to disable login with the ssh key created at the beginning

Set the hostname of the server, as root

 $ sudo hostname HOSTNAME

Edit the `/etc/hosts` file to include `HOSTNAME` appended to the end of the 127.0.0.1 entry

== Add content from a previous host

On the previous host, create a backup of all files in the user's home directory  `tar cvzpf userbak.tar.gz /home/user/`

Use SCP to copy the file from the old server to the new server.

 $ scp -P PORT USER@OLD_SERVER:FILE USER@NEW_SERVER:

On the new host, extract the files with the command `tar xzvf userbak.tar.gz`

== Set up sshguard

 $ sudo apt-get install sshguard

SSH guard monitors ssh connection attempts (`auth.log`) and blocks the IP address of failed logons in a certain period of time

Add IPs to a whitelist at `/etc/sshguard/whitelist`

I did a failed logon attempt for 2 different names within 17 seconds and my home IP address was blocked for >630 seconds. I then added my home public IP address to the whitecell.

== Set up the nginx server

 $ sudo apt-get install nginx

Use letsencrypt certificates

https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-nginx-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-16-04

Following the tutorial on a fress install of nginx

----
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python-certbot-nginx
----

Configure nginx to answer for the proper hostname by editing the files in `/etc/nginx/sites-available/`

Initial configuration of the /etc/nginx/sites-available/willson.tk file

----
server {
    server_name willson.tk www.willson.tk;
    listen 80 default_server;
    listen [::]:80 default_server;
    return 302 https://$server_name$request_uri;
} 

server {
    server_name willson.tk www.willson.tk;
    listen [::]:443 ssl ipv6only=on; # managed by Certbot
    listen 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot
    location / {
        # First attempt to serve request as file, then
        # as directory, then fall back to displaying a 404.
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        root /var/www/html;
        # Add index.php to the list if you are using PHP
        index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;
    }

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/willson.tk/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/willson.tk/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot       
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot         
}

== Set up guacamole server

The writeup `setup_guac_server.adoc` contains instruction for how to install guacamole.
