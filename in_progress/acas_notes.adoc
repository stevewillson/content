= ACAS Notes from Class

Monthly working group for ACAS - 4th Wednesday of month at 1000 and 1300 EST

DEPS Website for ACAS - discussion for ACAS

Patches.csd.disa.mil for ACAS Best Practices Guide

HP responded to the RFP and put in nessus scanner with security scanner and passive scanner.

Components of ACAS

Security Center - here to update plugins
Comprised of tools
Nessus - scans for vulnerabilities IAVMs, and compliance scan, 8834
PVS - makes this a continuous monitoring solution, can connect to a SPAN port, also uses plugins and scripts to ID a passive vuln, 8835
3D Tool - need to configure through security center, can display a topology of the network, port 443

vuln is a weakness that can lead to a compromise

Questions
Is PVS used?

CMRS - cont monitoring and risk scoring

quantitative - score based

13-670 - implement of ACAS - have 7 days to fix critical or high vulns

Task order - 14-0294 - task order for using CMRS

<<<<<<< HEAD
== Best Practice Guide

Use of Nessus web interface should be limited to initial setup, troubleshooting, and disconnected environments.

It is the responsibility of the deploying organization to purchase RHEL prior to deploying ACAS

Review scheduled tasks to ensure that users are not scheduling multiple tasks for the same time

Review dashboards that are created, should be made by 1 user and shared, not multiple users? PAGE 13
Refresh frequency of a dashboard should be less than 1 day.

Track how often the data changes, and then don't set the frequency more often than the data changes.

How are their scanners deployed? Distributed or consolidated?

Should HBSS be deployed to Nessus? PAGE 15, see ACAS HBSS integration guide.

Scanning through a firewall can be done, but requires scan policy tuning, firewall, and host configurations

Security Center <-> Nessus via XML-RPC on TCP port 8834


=======
ACAS can scan the mobile device server

Queries - can save filters to view for dashboards


Scans - 
active scans
an agent can be run on the server and then results can be reported back
scan policies - can set up a policy with a name
audit files with 

credentials - can set up credentials stored in

blackout windows - set up times not to scan

CMRS need to put things in the scan report

Assets - need to ensure that their assets are properly listed?
named container that contains a list of IP address or DNS results

workflow 
* alerts - can find vulnerabilities that match certain conditions
* tickets - built in ticketing system - scaled down ticketing system

Can 'accept risk rules' on the workflow tab

Can change the severity of a vulnerability using the 'recast risk rules'

Users groups roles

Can adjust 

About Security Center

System Logs - can see system logs


Feeds - 
can go to DOD patch repository, download plugins, and then upload them to the ACAS servers.

The feed contains templates - Tenable makes reports and other templates for use


Notifications

Plugins - can upload custom plugins using the 'Upload Custom Plugins' 

Security Center Help - can get there through the user icon and then help

Can adjust time zone on the ACAS server  


== Building Blocks for ACAS

Things that an Admin has to do before scanning

Admin
Security Manager
Operator / Analyst

Set people up for roles - 

Scan Zones

Put zones in and associate a nessus scanner with that zone

Then you scan a particular IP range


How to integrate data from another sec center?

can set up repo to copy their data
they can provide their scan data


`Scan Zone`
range of IPs and an assoc nessus scanner

Repositorys

hold scan results - folder where scan results are written

Set up repo to include scans for a particular IP range

Admin sets up the Organization and sets up the repo

The admin gives the organization the rights to a repo, the ORG does not 'own' the repo


DISA puts plugins on the DOD Patch Repository

Plugin lists
1-10000 - PBS
10001-900000 - active nessus
900000 - 999999 - custom plugin
1,000,000+ - compliance plugins


Isolated and Stand alone networks

can install sec center and nessus using the kickstart file
can use a VM with sec center and a nessus scanner as a VM
can run the nessus scanner on a stand alone laptop and then carry

nessus scanners are licensed through the security center - ACAS is not licensed to run a stand alone nessus scanner

Organization - group of individuals who are responsible for a set of common tasks

Scan Zone - defined static range of IP addrs with an assoc nessus scanner

== Vulnerability Scanning

Create scan policy
Create a scan
Launch a scan
View the scan results

=== Create a host discovery scan

scan 

Create a host discovery policy

'Add' - use a tenable template

Host Discovery

Policies - host discovery

Templates can be updated by the feed from tenable

Can add a scan, set the IP range, and then click the 'play' button.
Can see the scan running

Find the scan results by clicking on the 

Can troubleshoot using the All Vulnerabilities 

Gear icon - 'View' to see results
Can use this area to see the scan results and the authentication attempted (if attempting to use auth)

Can add restricted IP addresses to not scan those.


Discovery Scan
Operating System Scan
Basic network scan - dependent on OS scan - has plugins baked in

Create a custom vuln scan - can set up dependent based on basic network scan

custom vuln scan - 

Scan sequence - sec center 

Retrieve scan settings from SC
Host Disc
Port scan
Service detection
OS Detection
Scan for Vuln Detection

*If the scan job doesn't have credentials, then it will try to guess*

Will run a vuln scan based only on what nessus thinks the host is

*DISA wants you to run a monthly credentialed scan*

Add new scan

Basic Network Scan

will try to scan 30 simultaneous hosts, 4 checks per host (DEFAULT) 



Custom vulnerability scan

policies -> add -> custom advanced tab

Provides total control over the policy

Can configure many options using the custom scan
* wake on LAN

Can change your AV grace period - most DOD systems allow 7 days of AV out of date

Plugins tab - shows all plugins that are enabled for this instance.

Module 5-7 - Best Practices - goes through how nessus does its scanning, seems like only modules that are targeted at the guessed OS

Can add an unlimited number of WIN credentials - Module 5-10

TIP: Recommend to just scan windows hosts and then the linux hosts - depends on the network.

Some students only scan 2500 hosts at a time

Scanning Blackout Windows - prevents scans from happening at a certain time

can set a particular, by repository, if you have a blackout window set for a particular repository, then scans for other repositories will run

blackout windows will prevent scheduled scans from running

== Review for Vuln Scanning

Components of an Active Vuln Scan consist of a policy, credentials, scan zone, schedule, repository, and target list

Can track hosts issued new IP address - should enable for DHCP

common ports - 4605 ports that are common ports



== Assest Lists

named lists of ip or dns names that can be used to name a list of 

can attach an asset list to a person - responsibility

Types
* Static
* Dynamic - built based off a query
* DNS - put in based on DNS name, close to a static
* LDAP - built based on a query

Can create a combination asset list

Click 'assets' on the top of the menu

Can share asset lists, 

When exporting, it appears that the definition is Base64 encoded

If you share an asset list with others, need to make sure they are able to see them from their organization

Dynamic asset list is generated based of the scan results that have already taken place.

== Active Vuln Analysis

How to scan specific machines to prove that they are remediated.

Can view a vulnerability detail list

Can see the duration of the scan to troubleshoot which machines are taking a long time

Recommend putting credentialed and uncredentialed scans in different repositories.

Not a requirement to run a non-credentialed scan, but it can be a way to see what an outsider sees from your network

IAVM Number is listed in the Cross References section


Vulnerabilities Page

will show a cumulative list of all the vulnerabilities that are present

Crit - 7 days

Medium - local guidelines


Need to review the task order for ACAS scanning

Remediation Summary - will show what patches are required to fix vulnerabilities


Analysis Tools
* IAVM Summary - id host and # plugin by iavm
* MS Bulletin - updateing
* Software List - will show what is on host, check for approved/not approvied
* Remediation Summary - show soln for fixing vulns

== Filters

vuln
id numbers
dates
workflow - can check to see if vulns have been accepted
target - can filter by hosts/Domain names


can save a query and then load the query

Can generate an asset list from a filter to use

=== Launch Redediation Scan

Can rescan for a particular vulnerability to show that it has been remediated

Will prepopulate with settings 

=== Accept Risk

Can 'accept risk' of a vulnerability - it will not show up any more in reports - can put in an expiration date

Will accept for your entire organization

=== Recast Risk

Can change the severity of a vulnerability 'recast the risk'

=== Queries

Analysis > Queries

Can share queries

Can build queries for reports, ticketing, scan results


== Passive Vulnerability Analysis

monitoring network at the packet layer

passive vulnerability scanning

passive attack scripting language - scripting languate that PVS is written in

2 network interfaces - 1 for management, 1 for sniffing

Where to put the PVS? Monitor the border and then key networks that you're interested in

If storing in the same database, can sort by the plugin type

== Compliance Auditing and Vulnerability Scanning

Compliance module is used for commercial modules, DISA provides compliance modules

Security and Compliance

Audit files - bundle of scripts that contain specific configuration, file permission and access control tests to be performed.

Tenable Network sec template
DISA - .zip files, .xccdf DISA stig automated benchmark files
NIST - .xccdf - automated benchmark files

ACAS only scans for an reports on automated checks

Someone running the scans or administrators can upload audit files

The compliance checks will be imported and listed as plugins - in the 1,000,000 plugin ID range

Tests will PASS, FAIL, or be UNABLE TO DETERMINE

Download AUDIT FILES, can read the sourcecode of an audit file - XML document

SCANS > AUDIT FILES > ADD > Custom 'Advanced' > Choose File (Choose .xccdf)

=== Compliance Auditing

Add Policy > SCAP and OVAL Auditing 

Active > Scans > Add

Choose policy and name, select repository

DISA recommends that you have a separate Repository for compliance scans

Reused the 'severity' field in the compliance checks, if FAILED put 'HIGH', if passes put 'INFORMATIONAL', if UNABLE TO GET RESULTS put 'Medium'

* 10 points for a 'HIGH'
* 3 points for  a 'MEDIUM'
* 0 points for an 'INFORMATIONAL'

Need to review scan results to troubleshoot the scan results, can see an 'authentication failure' or 'wrong credentials' when troubleshooting scans

Can view the list of vulnerabilities by 'Vulnerability Summary' or 'IP Summary'

Can filter to just view those with 'HIGH' severity

== Reporting

6 report formats

CSV
PDF
RTF

More formats for CMRS

ASR
ARF
CyberScope - xml


Scans fill database up, reports query database to show information in a useful way

From repository - can generate reports

Report definition - XML format - can be used to have a consistent report format

Can add the definition tab
Distribution - select who will receive the report

Can add new templates through the security center feed

=== Custom Reports

Can copy reports and modify them to take certain elements of a pre-built report

== Dashboards

Options > Add Dashboard

Dashboards just query the repositories, they do not run new scans

Add a component

Can set an update frequency for the dashboard

Export dashboards, can keep references or remove all references

Assurance report cards - many organizations have policies
Behind each report card is a list of policies

CCC - Critical Cyber Controls

Through module 11


== Installation

Security Center runs on Red Hat 6 at least or newer

Nessus and PVS run on Red Hat or Windows

3d tool runs only on Windows

Kickstart RHEL 6 image

Need to get license for security center, nessus scanners are licensed off of the security center

Total users * repositories * asset lists = # (should be less than 1,000,000)

This is a recommendation for best practices

Steps
* Get sec center license
* get installation media
* read documentation
* modify firewall

Licenses expire every year in february - need to renew yearly

=== Nessus installation

4 cores - 8-12 gb ram

8834 port for nessus to be open, tells it that it is managed by security center

PVS 4 cores 8-12 gb

8835 port for PVS 

License from security center,

Need to limit the PVS scan pool, it will be set to ingest IPs

== Administration of ACAS

can set a date to remove the active vulnerability data (default 365 days)

passive data is held for 7 days

=== Admin best practices

should enforce separation of duties

Can assign someone an asset list that limits what they can see in the database

== Scan Zone

run a scan off of a scan zone, and then the results will be put into the repository

schedule scans so that the network is not overloaded with traffic.
