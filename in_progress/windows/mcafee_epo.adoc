= How to setup a McAfee ePO Lab

== Requirements

2 Windows Server instances
Windows host computers

Download the McAfee ePO trial to server A

Set up one of the Windows Server instances as a domain controller (server B)

Add server A to the domain established by server B.

Setup SQL server on server A (included with the epo trial).

Need to learn how to configure the SQL server. - I am not able to get this to work at this time.

Run the setup executable in the ePO trial folder.

This will install the ePolicy Orchestrator server.

I installed the server on Windows 2016, need to download and use Firefox to open the browser. I tried with IE and it froze.



Login with the credentials specified.


Open up a host and download the McAfee Agent on that host.

Can navigate to the ePO server on a domain connected machine, log in, and then download the McAfee Agent. 


== Configuring Rogue System Detection

Go to `Guided Configuration` and select Rogue System Detection to check that piece of software in.

Can do AD Sync or Manual sync to add machines to the configuration.


== AD Sync

Can set up a regular task to ensure that McAfee syncs with AD,

What is the best practice for regular syncing? Daily hourly? How often?

To set up an automatic sync go to `Menu > Automation > Server Tasks` 

Select `Active Directory Synchronization / NT Domain` task action in the Actions page of the Server Task Builder.

To do a manual sync, go to Menu (3 bars in upper right), select System Tree and then select `Group Details`. Make sure that you have `My Group` selected on the left (or whatever group that you would like to Sync with AD.)


== Adding a computer to a domain

First, set the DNS server to be the proper DNS server set up by AD

Then go to `This PC` properties and select the Change Domain button and enter the desired domain set up by the DC.

Then enter an administrator to add the comptuer to the domain, the workstation will now be added to the domain in the `Computers` OU.


== Configuration -> Registered Servers

Add a server as an LDAP server, be sure to type in the right username password combination.



== Ports used (default)

Agent wake up communication port 8081

Why does an install fail sometimes? Bad password, the domain is improperly set

I'm not able to log in to the machines typically



Future Work

Read about the HIPS firewall to create configurations to block ingress and egress traffic

Read about rogue system detection to enumerate and block bad systems

Researc best practices automatically setting up a windows server with machines joined as a domain

PowerShell desired state configuration?

I want to set up infrastructure, then make a template for a default setup,

just to configure a sample Domain controller and lots of users
