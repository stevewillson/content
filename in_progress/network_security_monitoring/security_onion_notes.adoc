.Key points:
* Security Onion is a Network Security Monitoring linux distribution based on Ubuntu
* It does 3 things: full packet capture, NIDS&HIDS, contains analysis tools
* Can be deployed in standalone and server-sensor configurations
* Setup can be automated through the sosetup script

https://github.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/security-onion/wiki/Hardware

.HW Requirements
* 2 VCPUs, 8GB RAM Minimum

.Sensor Requirements
* Rough estimate is 200Mbps per Snort instance, Suricata worker, or Bro worker 
* 2 CPUs per worker

https://github.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/security-onion/wiki/ProductionDeployment

.Production Deployment Suggestions
* Configure the master server first
* Sensors connect to master through 22, 4505, 4506 (Salt), and 7736
* Install metapackages (securityonion-all, securityonion-onionsalt)
* Use a text config file `sosetup.conf` to automate setup

THe above link contains a walkthrough for setting up a production deployment.

Should create a user account on the master for each sensor.

Setup will evenly divide the CPUs across the IDS and Bro processes if choosing best practices.

.PostInstallation:
* Check service status `sudo service nsm status`
* Setup only opens port 22 (SSH), need to allow other ports through `so-allow`
* Disable unneeded sensor processes
* Could place `/etc` under version control

== BPF Filter Structure

https://github.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/security-onion/wiki/BPF

.Structure of the bpf.conf files
* `/etc/nsm/rules/bpf.conf` is copied from the master server
* There is a daily cronjob that will copy this file to the sensors
* Per-process bpf files are symlinked to the interface bpf and the interface bpf is symlinked to the global bpf.conf

== Timezones

https://github.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/security-onion/wiki/TimeZones

Recommend using UTC, use `sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata` set to UTC


== Services

https://github.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/security-onion/wiki/Services

Controlled by NSM scripts, seems like securityonion was born out of a linux distro that had lots of scripts to do lots of NSM things.

The directory `/usr/sbin` contains many of these scripts. Most begin with `so-` or `nsm_server_`

Hopefully it will move towards services running in docker containers.


== Elastic Stack Architecture

https://github.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/security-onion/wiki/Elastic-Architecture

Docker containers based off CentOS7


== Xplico

xplico takes pcap files and extracts application layer data

Will be EOL on 05JUN18.
