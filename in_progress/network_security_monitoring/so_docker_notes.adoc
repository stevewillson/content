= Docker Notes

Reference: https://docs.docker.com/get-started/#images-and-containers

Container is a runtime instance of an image.

List running containers with `docker ps`

List the available docker images `docker image ls`


Clone the security-onion-docker repository and build the docker containers locally.

 $ git clone git@github.com:Security-Onion-Solutions/securityonion-docker.git

Execute the `0_build_images.sh` script

 $ 0_build_images.sh

This will build the docker images locally.

Start one of the docker images

Clone the repo for security onion docker integration for elastic.

 $ git clone https://github.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/securityonion-elastic.git

Files for configuring SO exist in `~/CLONED_REPO/usr/sbin/`

These files act as the glue that connects many of the security onion components together.
