= Redis Notes

Tutorial available at: try.redis.io

Key-value store, often referred to as a NoSQL database.

Store some data (value) inside a key. Data can be retrieved if the exact key is known.

Use the command `SET` to store the value 'fido' at key 'server:name'

`SET server:name "fido"`

`GET server:name` replies with `"fido"`

Other common operations: `DEL` (delete a given key and associated value), `SETNX` (set if not exists), `INCR` (increment a number stored at a given key)

Redis provides many atomic operations to interact with data.

A key can be made to only exist for a defined amount of time (`EXPIRE`)

Use the `EXPIRE` command and a key followed by a number to specify the number of seconds that a key will last

* -1 - the key will never expire
* -2 - the key is expired

Query how much time remains with the `TTL` command

Supports many other complex data structures.

* List - series of ordered values

.Commands to interact with a list
* `RPUSH` - appends a value to the list
* `LPUSH` - inserts a value at the beginning of the list
* `LRANGE` - gives a subset of the list, use `-1` to mean the end of the list, need to provide the start and end index of the list (inclusive)
* `LLEN` - returns the length of the list
* `LPOP` - removes the first element of the list and returns it
* `RPOP` - removes the last element of the list and returns it

== Set 

set - similar to a list except it does not have a specific order and each element may only appear once.

.Commands
* `SADD` - adds a value to the set
* `SREM` - removes a value from the set
* `SISMEMBER` - tests if the given value is in the set
* `SMEMBERS` - returns a list of all the members of this set
* `SUNION` - combines two or more sets and returns the list of all elements

Sorted sets have a score attached to each of the elements that is used to sort them.

* `ZADD` - set a value and score to a particular key, the score is an integer used to sort the values
* `ZRANGE` - get the values between those positions

== Hashes

Hashes are maps between string fields and string values.

* `HSET` - sets the value of a key to a string and a value for that string
* `HGETALL` - gets all of the values for the given key
* `HMSET` - sets multiple fields for a hash at once
* `HGET` - gets a particular value for a key

Numerical values can be incremented in hash fields.

`HINCRBY` - increments the hash value in the key by a defined amount
`HDEL` - deletes a hash value
